# 🍕 Dominos - Predictive Purchase Order System

This project builds a **predictive purchase order system** for a pizza chain using historical sales data. The goal is to forecast **pizza sales quantities** for the upcoming week using **Facebook Prophet**, and then automatically generate a **purchase order of required ingredients** based on predicted sales volumes.

## 📊 Project Overview

**Industry Domain:** Food Service  
**Problem Type:** Forecasting + Recommendation System  
**Primary Objective:**  
To forecast pizza sales (quantity) for the next 7 days using Facebook Prophet and generate a weekly ingredient-level **purchase order**.

How It Works
Data Preprocessing

Converts order timestamps into proper datetime format

Filters invalid rows (e.g., NaT values)

Aggregates quantity sold by day

Time Series Forecasting

Trains a Facebook Prophet model on daily quantity sold

Forecasts quantity for the next 7 days

Visualizes actual vs predicted sales and seasonal components

Ingredient Demand Estimation

Calculates historical pizza-type proportions

Distributes forecasted pizza quantities by proportion

Multiplies by per-pizza ingredient requirements to estimate total ingredient needs

Generates purchase order and visualizes it as a horizontal bar chart

✅ Results
Forecast Accuracy: Reported using MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

Final Output:

Forecast table for next 7 days

DataFrame of required ingredients with rounded quantity (in KG)

Purchase Order Barplot (sorted by quantity)

🚀 Future Enhancements
Use LSTM or other deep learning models for forecasting

Include price-based optimization for bulk purchasing

Handle multiple stores or regions

Add Streamlit interface for live forecasts and reports
